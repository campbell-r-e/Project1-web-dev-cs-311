        <p id = "index7"> For Amateur Radio their is three levels of licenses. </p>
        <ol id="list"value="Licenses from entry level to highest level">
            <li>Technician</li>
            <li>General</li>
            <li>Amateur Extra</li>
          </ol>
        <p id = "index8">The Technician class license allows you to have all Amataeur Radio privleges above 50mhz and Technicians have some privleges below
            30 mhz but they are mostly morse code or data emmissions. The General Class license gives you most HF privleges which are frequncies 
            below 30 mhz.The Amateur Extra class license on the other hand gives you all Amataeur radio frequncy privleges.

          <H2 id = "index9">Test study Information</H2>
        <p id = "index10">The first license test you would take in Amateur Radio is the Technician class license. 
            The Technician test has 35 questions and they are all multiple choice. 
            You can study for each test using books or online resources.
            I would recomend using a website called  <a id = "index12" href="https://hamstudy.org/" target="_blank" alt = "Link to HamStudy">
            HamStudy.
            </a>. Hamstudy allows you to take practice tests for all the questions in the question pool. The program even has a flash card mode to drill you on all the 
            questions in the question pool.Their are also lots of youtube videos that will help you. After your are ready for the test you need to schecdule a test session 
            to take the test. hamstudy allows for you to register for exams as well. You can take the exam online or in person. Most tests are 15 dollars and some are offerd for free. 
            I would also recomend contacting a club near you and ask them if they are planning any test sessions.
